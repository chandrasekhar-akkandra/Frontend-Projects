### Component Hierarchy
- **App Component**: Main application wrapper
- **Router Setup**: Navigation and route management
- **Redux Provider**: Global state management
- **Layout Components**: Header, Footer, Navigation
- **Feature Components**: Product listing, cart, checkout

## 🛡️ State Management Strategy

### Redux Store Structure
```javascript
{
  products: {
    items: [],
    loading: false,
    error: null
  },
  cart: {
    items: [],
    totalQuantity: 0,
    totalPrice: 0
  },
  user: {
    isAuthenticated: false,
    userInfo: {}
  }
}
```

### Key Actions
- `FETCH_PRODUCTS_SUCCESS`: Load product catalog
- `ADD_TO_CART`: Add item to shopping cart
- `REMOVE_FROM_CART`: Remove item from cart
- `UPDATE_QUANTITY`: Modify item quantities
- `CLEAR_CART`: Empty shopping cart

## 🎯 Core Functionality

### Product Management
- **Product Display**: Grid and list view options
- **Category Filtering**: Filter by product categories
- **Price Sorting**: Sort by price (low to high, high to low)
- **Product Details**: Detailed product information pages

### Shopping Cart
- **Add to Cart**: Seamless product addition
- **Quantity Management**: Increase/decrease quantities
- **Price Calculation**: Real-time total calculations
- **Persistent State**: Cart persists across sessions

### User Experience
- **Responsive Navigation**: Mobile-friendly menu
- **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback during API calls
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
